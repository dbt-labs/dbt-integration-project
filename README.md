# Sample DBT Project
## For integration tests

This project contains four branches:
  - master
  - configs
  - dbt/0.17.0
  - 1.0

### master

The `master` branch doesn't require any configs to run.


### with-configs

The `with-configs` branch _does_ require configs to run.


### dbt/0.17.0

The `dbt/0.17.0` branch sets the config-version to 2 for compatibility with 0.17.0.


### 1.0

The `1.0` branch is just `dbt/0.17.0` but with a branch name that looks like a float.
